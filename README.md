# Atari 2600 ROM dumper

If you have an old Atari 2600 cartridge and want to play it on your computer using an emulator, you'll need to download that game from the cartridge memory into a ROM file. This process is usually called "ROM dumping". 

This is probably the simplest and easiest circuit you can make to download an Atari game from the cartridge. It uses only an Arduino board.
